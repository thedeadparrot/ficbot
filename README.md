List of things I needed to do to get this working:


1. install python-dev, libssl-dev and libffi-dev, libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. run `nltk.download()` and pull a bunch of grammar parsers and packages (book grammars)


TODO:
- fix spacing issues
- contractions
- larger corpus
